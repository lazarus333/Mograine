**Description:**
 Quest : Honor is for the Weak Zone: Icecrown. Restless lookouts are not supposed to aggro the ghost you are under control if you don't approach them from the front, as the
 quest objecive is to kill them from behind and with this bug it is extremely difficult to do what the quest is asking.

**How to reproduce:**
approach a restless lookout from the behind while transformed into quest pet.

**How it should work:**
When you approach a restles lookout as possesed ghost/quest pet from behind they shouldn't aggro the ghost you are controlling.
